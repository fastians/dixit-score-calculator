# Dixit Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the **Dixit** game. The game can be played by a group of 3 to 8 players, where each player has their own unique color and a score is tracked throughout the rounds.

The project is built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Material UI** components for modals and buttons.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Player Management**: Add, remove, and update player names and colors.
- **Score Tracking**: Players can submit scores for each round, and the total score is dynamically calculated.
- **Winner Popup**: A modal appears when a player reaches the victory score.
- **Game Reset**: A reset modal confirms if the user wants to restart the game.
- **Interactive Background**: The background responds to mouse movement for a dynamic effect.
- **Customizable Player Colors**: Players can select their own color using a hidden color picker.
